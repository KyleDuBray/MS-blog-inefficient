# MS-node-react-blog-inefficient
A blog app example using Express and React. Demonstrates use of microservices architecture inefficiently by making nested requests for previously retrieved data on current renders. See other repo that demonstrates an efficient use of microservices using an event bus and query service.

# Getting Started with the scripts

n each of the directories- client, posts, and comments, you can run:

### `npm install`, then `npm start`

to start the frontend client and both backends.

See https://github.com/KyleDuBray/MS-blog-efficient for the efficient and "correct" implementation of this project. These projects are not meant to be full, production-ready applications. They are only meant to give a glimpse of microservices in action.
